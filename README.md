This is the theoretical outline of the PARRA framework. Here we show the implementation. 

* <a href="https://corinnebowers.github.io/sonoma.html">sonoma.Rmd</a>: generates a figure of Sonoam County with rivers, creeks, and major cities/towns identified, as well as a figure inset of California for context
* <a href="https://corinnebowers.github.io/rp100.html">rp100.Rmd</a>: performs sensitivity analysis and best-fit calibration for LISFLOOD environmental parameters (floodplain roughness, channel shape, etc.)
